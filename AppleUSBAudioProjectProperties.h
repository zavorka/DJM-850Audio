 * This file is for inclusion in plists as well as C source. plists are preprocessed with the C
 * preprocessor as well. But the C preprocessor will leave C declarations in the file, which then
 * collide with the XML. 
 * For this reason, this file may:
 * - only contain comments and preprocessor macros
 * - not contain any single-line comments ('//')
 * - only have preprocessor directives that start at the first column (no leading spaces)
 * - only include files that adhere to the same rules.
